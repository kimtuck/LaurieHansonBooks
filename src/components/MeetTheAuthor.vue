            Laurie wanted to capture the joy and happiness that Treasure brought to her family. A book was the perfect
            medium; and having Treasure be the focus of the story allows the enthusiasm that Treasure felt every day to come
            through. You can tell that Treasure wasn't just a dog; she was a teammate; a great friend and a joy to live with.
