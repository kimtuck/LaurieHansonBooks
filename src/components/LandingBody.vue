                What a wonderful book! We gave to a lovely, and lively, little girl on Christmas Eve. She sat still on her
                grandma's lap and insisted that Grandma read it over and over. She simply loved it!

            Treasure and her best friend, Annie, get some sad news -- Annie's family is moving. Annie is worried that she
            won't have any friends in the new neighborhood, and her birthday is only two weeks away! But Treasure has a plan.
            Can Treasure help Annie make new friends?
